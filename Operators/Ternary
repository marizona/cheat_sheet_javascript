<condition> ? <value1> : <value2>;

The ternary operator starts with conditional expression followed by the ? operator. 
The second part (after ? and before :) will be executed if the condition turns out to be true. 
Suppose, the condition returns false, then the third part (after :) will be executed.

Example: Ternary operator

var a = 10, b = 5;

var c = a > b? a : b; // value of c would be 10
var d = a > b? b : a; // value of d would be 5
