= 	Assigns right operand value to the left operand.
+= 	Sums up left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
-= 	Subtract right operand value from the left operand value and assigns the result to the left operand.
*= 	Multiply left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
/= 	Divide left operand value by right operand value and assign the result to the left operand.
%= 	Get the modulus of left operand divide by right operand and assign resulted modulus to the left operand. 

Example: Assignment operators

var x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;

x = y; //x would be 10

x += 1; //x would be 6

x -= 1; //x would be 4

x *= 5; //x would be 25

x /= 5; //x would be 1

x %= 2; //x would be 1
